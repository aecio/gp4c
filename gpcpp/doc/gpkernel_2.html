<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="gpkernel_toc.html#TOC29">2.1  Initial Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
To investigate the influence of some important configuration parameters
of the Genetic Programming kernel, a problem which can be quickly
calculated was selected: the lawn-mower problem (See Koza's book).

</P>
<P>
The lawn-mower problem can be described as follows.  Consider an
autonomous mower which must evolve the ability to mow the lawn it is
placed upon.  The lawn in question is a ten times ten grid toriodal
world.  Toriodal means that if the mower moves outside the lawn, it
automatically comes in again on the opposite side.  The mower has no
sensors.  It can move forward, turn left, and jump.

</P>
<P>
Starting from a reasonably good configuration, some parameters were
modified.  The starting configuration was:

<P>
As many as 50 runs were made for each parameter value.  The average
fitness values of the best performing genetic programs were recorded for
each generation.

</P>
<P>
This study was done to determine the influence of the Genetic
Programming control parameters.  The conclusions that can be drawn from
the study are, however, not generally applicable to all problems.

<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="gpkernel_toc.html#TOC31">2.3  Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
There are some conclusions that can be drawn from the parameter study:

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

In general: <STRONG>The faster the convergence in the first generations,
the worse is the best achievable result, and vice versa.</STRONG>
<LI>

The population size should not fall below a certain minimum value.  This
value depends on the problem.  When extremely good results are needed,
nothing is better than a large population size.  A cross check was done
to underline this.  A population size of 500 was run for 2000
generations, but it did not yield an equally good result than the
population size 5000 running for 200 generations (this particular run
took 15 hours 35 minutes CPU time on an Ultra Sparc SUN workstation).
By the way, the program consumed about 62MB memory with a population
size of 5000.  Using steady state can reduce this to approximately half
the amount, of course.
<LI>

If the steady state Genetic Programming is used, the results of the
first generations are better.
<LI>

Tournament selection performs better, except when running a lot of
generations.
<LI>

The higher the crossover probability, the faster the convergence.  The
first conclusion does not appear to be applicable to this parameter.
<LI>

With the parameters from above, demetic grouping has no effect.  This
changes with the deme size and the demetic migration probability,
reduction of which slows down convergence.
<LI>

The effect of swap mutation is marginal.
<LI>

Shrink mutation can yield better results.  The reason for this is that
the calculation of the standardised fitness takes the tree length into
account, and shrink mutation therefore helps improving the fitness.
<LI>The tournament size has a big effect.  The smaller it is, the

better the best achievable result.
<LI>

The creation types <EM>Variable</EM> and <EM>RampedVariable</EM> should not
be used.  The reason for their bad performance in the few first
generations may be that during creation, the chance of selecting a
function node or a terminal node is equal.  This can lead to short
trees.
<LI>

The parameter <EM>MaximumDepthForCreation</EM> should not be too low.
