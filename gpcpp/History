0.50  (15/1/97)
---------------

First version

0.5.1 (28/1/97)
---------------

Shrink mutation faster

Bug in GP::load(): Length and depth was not calculated

config.h renamed to gpconfig.h

Prefix GP added to all names of module config

Bug in GPGene::chooseFunctionNode(): If no function node, floating
point exception

Bug in GP::mutate(): flag fitnessValid not set to 0

Steady State feature added.  The following had to change because of
this:

- Arguments and return value of GPPopulation::tournamentSelection(),
  GPPopulation::probabilisticSelection() changed.

- New function GPPopulation::selectIndices().

- New GPVariables parameter SteadyState.

New GPVariables parameter AddBestToNewPopulation, CrossoverProbability
and CreationProbability.  The Parameters ReproductionRation and
CreationRatio are no longer valid.

Selection mechanism for Demetic Migration is now one of the usual
ones, not just random selection.  (Was possible because of the new
function GPPopulation::selectIndices())

0.5.2 (13/2/97)
---------------

Bug in GPPopulation::calculateStatistics(): The calculation of the
worst of the population was wrong, and in some weird cases the best of
the population was wrong, too.  This was not a severe bug, but can
cause unnecessary trouble.

Bug in GP::compare: Returned value 1 when the trees were the same.

Documentation: Parameter study added.
