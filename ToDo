Some things are still to do
===========================

The assignment-operator for all kernel classes is not yet implemented.

When creating new trees in generate(), they are not checked whether
they are valid using function checkForValidCreation().

Documentation of the examples

The configuration module does not satisfy me.  I would prefer a C++
module that can read ".ini" file in the Windows style (even though I
don't like windows).  Furthermore, the kernel should be able to read
the parameter it needs from such a configuration object.  This way it
is easier to extend the parameter class GPVariables without the need
for the user to change his/her code.
